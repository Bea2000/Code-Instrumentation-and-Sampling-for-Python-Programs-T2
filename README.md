# Code Instrumentation and Sampling for Python Programs

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of the Software Testing course during the second semester of 2022 at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. The main focus of the project is to explore dynamic analysis techniques, specifically **code instrumentation** and **sampling**, to collect and report runtime data of Python programs.

The project involves modifying an existing instrumentor to collect metrics on function calls and execution times, as well as implementing a call context tree using a sampling method.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
- To understand the logic behind code instrumentation and sampling techniques used in dynamic analysis.
- To grasp the advantages, limitations, and trade-offs of these techniques.
- To implement an instrumentor that reports various metrics about the functions in a Python program.
- To modify a sampler to produce a **Call Context Tree**, showing execution time per method in different call contexts.

## Key Features
### Instrumentor (Code Instrumentation)
The instrumentor collects the following metrics during the execution of Python programs:
- **Frequency**: The number of times each function is called.
- **Execution Time**: The maximum, minimum, and average time taken by each function.
- **Callers**: The functions that invoked each analyzed function.
- **Cacheable**: Identifies functions that could benefit from caching, based on repeated argument patterns and return values.

### Sampler (Code Sampling)
The sampler is used to build a **Call Context Tree**, which shows the execution time of functions in the context of their calling environment. This is done by periodically checking the execution stack of a program.

## Project Structure
- **`instrumentor/`**: Contains the code for the instrumentor, which analyzes Python programs by instrumenting their functions.
- **`instrumentor/input_code/`**: Sample Python code for testing the instrumentor.
- **`sampler/`**: Contains the code for the sampler, which analyzes the call context of functions during execution.
- **`sampler/input_code/`**: Sample Python code for testing the sampler.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the **instrumentor** directory:

    ```bash
    cd instrumentor
    ```

    To run the **instrumentor** on a Python program, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 profile.py code{i}
    ```

    This will produce a report in the console, showing metrics like function frequency, execution time, and caller relationships.

3. Navigate to the **sampler** directory:

    ```bash
    cd sampler
    ```

    To run the **sampler** on a Python program, use the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 profile.py code{i}
    ```

    This will output a Call Context Tree, showing the execution time of each function in various contexts.

## Example Output

### Instrumentor Output

```bash
fun     freq   avg     max     min     cache   callers
main    1      13.013  13.013  13.013  1       []
foo     1      13.013  13.013  13.013  1       ['main']
bar     2      5.011   5.015   5.007   0       ['foo']
```

### Sampler Output

```bash
total (7 seconds)
    _bootstrap (7 seconds)
        _bootstrap_inner (7 seconds)
            run (7 seconds)
                execute_script (7 seconds)
                    <module> (6 seconds)
                        main(6 seconds)
                            foo(6 seconds)
                                bar(1 second)
                            zoo(3 seconds)
                                bar(1 second)
```

## How to Test

- The project includes several sample Python programs located in the input_code directories of both the instrumentor and sampler. You can run these examples as described above to see the functionality in action.
